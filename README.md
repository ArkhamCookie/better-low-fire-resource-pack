# Low on Fire HUD

A simple Minecraft resource pack that changes fire to be lower only on your HUD.
The difference between this pack and most is that it **only** affects the HUD;
fire on the ground is unchanged.

## Attributions

The textures for the fire was created by [gitq](https://modrinth.com/user/gitq) and is licensed under the MIT license.
The logo of this resource pack is one of the blue fire animations.
**gitq did all the hard work for this pack.**
I just packaged it differently so it doesn't change the fire on the ground.
Their orginal pack is [Better Low Fire](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/better-low-fire).
